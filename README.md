# nettyx

#### Introduce
Based on [netty4.1.101. Final], ultra-lightweight packaging has been carried out, providing some tools and basic templates, as well as additional serial communication templates to help you quickly build netty-based server/client applications and serial port based applications

#### Installation Tutorial
1. Add Maven Dependencyï¼š

annotation
  ---FieldHandler                     When serializing fields, you can specify field serialization/deserialization logic
  ---Ignore                           ignore this field when serializing
  ---Length                           When serialized/deserialized, fields of array type must use this annotation to specify the length
  ---Struct                           In serialization, the domain type needs to be annotated, something like @Entity in JPA
